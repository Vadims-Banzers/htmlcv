        <h3>Personal statement</h3>
        <div style="margin-left:50px;margin-right:100px;">
            <p1 style="margin-left: 2.5em;">
                From a very young age, I have been interested in building and making things. When I was 9 I was invited to competition. I had to build a motorbike from any material, and I made it from dough (of course my parents helped me). I came 2nd and I won a small motorbike. When I was 12 I built a wooden car with elastic mechanism and I came 1st and I won a paper knife. And after these competitions I realised that I’m very good in making stuff. I love creating things and making them move so I decided to study mechanical and electrical engineering.<br />
                As I grew up I was really interested in computers. At age 13, I spent a few months helping my friends to create a server for a computer game. I was responsible for installing plugins and making sure that they work flawlessly. To be honest, I spent about 70% of that time troubleshooting the errors.<br />
                At age 14, I moved to England, I had a little knowledge of English, but it didn’t take me long to learn it. By the end of Year 11, I managed to get a grade 7(A) in Maths, a grade 5(B/C) in English Language and Literature, C in Science, B in ICT and A* in Russian.<br />
                After I had graduated from school, I decided to do BTEC Level 3 Engineering Extended Diploma. I chose that course because I wanted to do something technical, but I wasn’t sure what. Unfortunately, I did not find most of the course interesting, apart from working with electronics. After combining my passion to create things and electronics, I faced the problem – security on the internet.
                I have decided to study Computer Forensics and Security at Canterbury Christ Church University to pursue a career in cybersecurity to make internet and digital world more secure.
